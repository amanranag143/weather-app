Weather Forecast App

This weather forecast app is a web application developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It showcases the developer's skills in front-end web development and data integration.

User Interface
The interface features a search bar to input a city name, a display area for the current weather conditions, and a forecast for the next few days.

Functionality
The app fetches weather data from a third-party API using JavaScript's Fetch API or XMLHttpRequest. It displays information such as the current temperature, weather description, humidity, wind speed, and a forecast for the next few days.

Technical Implementation
The application uses HTML to structure the app's layout, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for handling user input, fetching weather data, and updating the display. The JavaScript code uses asynchronous programming techniques to handle the API requests and update the UI efficiently.
